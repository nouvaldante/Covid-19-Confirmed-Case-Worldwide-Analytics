# Covid-19-Confirmed-Case-Worldwide-Analytics

This is a simple data analysis and visualization projects about confirmed Covid-19 cases worldwide.

# Objectives :
1. To observe the growth trend of confirmed cases in various Southeast Asian Countries and other selected Asian nations.
2. To identify the top 5 countries with the most confirmed cases globally.
3. To visualize the trend comparison among these countries.

# Tools and Libraries
This project was developed entirely within a Jupyter Notebook environment along with several tools and libraries:

1. "**Python** : Main programming language.
2. **Pandas** : For data manipulation and cleaning.
3. **Numpy** : For statistical operation and analysis.
4. **Matplotlib and Seaborn** : Data visualization tools

# Workflow

1. **Data Loading** : Load the data into pandas dataframe.
2. **Data Preprocessing** : Coverting the 'Date' column into datetime format and checking for missing values.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** : Filtering data for specific regions (SEA and selected Asian countries), Identifying top 5 countries with most confirmed cases, Calculating the maximum confirmed cases for each country.
4. **Data Visualization** : Creating line plot to show and compare the growth trend of confirmed cases from each country.
5. **Conclusion** : Summarizing the key findings from the analysis.
